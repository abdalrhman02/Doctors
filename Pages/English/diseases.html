                    <h2 class="diseaseName">Depression:</h2>
                    <p>Depression is a mood disorder that causes a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest. Also called major depressive disorder or clinical depression, it affects how you feel, think and behave and can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems. You may have trouble doing normal day-to-day activities, and sometimes you may feel as if life isn't worth living.</p>
                    <p>More than just a bout of the blues, depression isn't a weakness and you can't simply "snap out" of it. Depression may require long-term treatment. But don't get discouraged. Most people with depression feel better with medication, psychotherapy or both.</p>
                
                    <div class="disTreatment">
                        <h3>Treatment:</h3>
                        <p>Medications and psychotherapy are effective for most people with depression. Your primary care doctor or psychiatrist can prescribe medications to relieve symptoms. However, many people with depression also benefit from seeing a psychiatrist, psychologist or other mental health professional.</p>
                        <p>If you have severe depression, you may need a hospital stay, or you may need to participate in an outpatient treatment program until your symptoms improve.</p>
                        <p>Here's a closer look at depression treatment options.</p>
                    
                        <h3>Medications:</h3>
                        <p>Many types of antidepressants are available, including those below. Be sure to discuss possible major side effects with your doctor or pharmacist.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs): </b> Doctors often start by prescribing an SSRI. These drugs are considered safer and generally cause fewer bothersome side effects than other types of antidepressants. SSRIs include citalopram (Celexa), escitalopram (Lexapro), fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil, Pexeva), sertraline (Zoloft) and vilazodone (Viibryd).</li>

                            <li><b>Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs):</b> Examples of SNRIs include duloxetine (Cymbalta), venlafaxine (Effexor XR), desvenlafaxine (Pristiq, Khedezla) and levomilnacipran (Fetzima).</li>
                        
                            <li><b>Atypical antidepressants:</b> These medications don't fit neatly into any of the other antidepressant categories. They include bupropion (Wellbutrin XL, Wellbutrin SR, Aplenzin, Forfivo XL), mirtazapine (Remeron), nefazodone, trazodone and vortioxetine (Trintellix).</li>

                            <li><b>Tricyclic antidepressants:</b> These drugs — such as imipramine (Tofranil), nortriptyline (Pamelor), amitriptyline, doxepin, trimipramine (Surmontil), desipramine (Norpramin) and protriptyline (Vivactil) — can be very effective, but tend to cause more-severe side effects than newer antidepressants. So tricyclics generally aren't prescribed unless you've tried an SSRI first without improvement.</li>

                            <li><b>Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs): </b> MAOIs — such as tranylcypromine (Parnate), phenelzine (Nardil) and isocarboxazid (Marplan) — may be prescribed, typically when other drugs haven't worked, because they can have serious side effects. Using MAOIs requires a strict diet because of dangerous (or even deadly) interactions with foods — such as certain cheeses, pickles and wines — and some medications and herbal supplements. Selegiline (Emsam), a newer MAOI that sticks on the skin as a patch, may cause fewer side effects than other MAOIs do. These medications can't be combined with SSRIs.</li>

                            <li><b>Other medications:</b> Other medications may be added to an antidepressant to enhance antidepressant effects. Your doctor may recommend combining two antidepressants or adding medications such as mood stabilizers or antipsychotics. Anti-anxiety and stimulant medications also may be added for short-term use.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h2 class="diseaseName">Anxiety disorder:</h2>
                    <p>Experiencing occasional anxiety is a normal part of life. However, people with anxiety disorders frequently have intense, excessive and persistent worry and fear about everyday situations. Often, anxiety disorders involve repeated episodes of sudden feelings of intense anxiety and fear or terror that reach a peak within minutes (panic attacks).</p>
                    <p>These feelings of anxiety and panic interfere with daily activities, are difficult control, are out of proportion to the actual danger and can last a long time. You may avoid places or situations to prevent these feelings. Symptoms may start during childhood or the teen years and continue into adulthood.</p>
                    <p>Examples of anxiety disorders include generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder (social phobia), specific phobias and separation anxiety disorder. You can have more than one anxiety disorder. Sometimes anxiety results from a medical condition that needs treatment.</p>
                    <p>Whatever form of anxiety you have, treatment can help.</p>
                
                    <div class="disTreatment">
                        <h3>Treatment:</h3>
                        <p>The two main treatments for anxiety disorders are psychotherapy and medications. You may benefit most from a combination of the two. It may take some trial and error to discover which treatments work best for you.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="disease">
                    <h2 class="diseaseName">Psychotherapy:</h2>
                    <p>Also known as talk therapy or psychological counseling, psychotherapy involves working with a therapist to reduce your anxiety symptoms. It can be an effective treatment for anxiety.</p>
                    <p>Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the most effective form of psychotherapy for anxiety disorders. Generally a short-term treatment, CBT focuses on teaching you specific skills to improve your symptoms and gradually return to the activities you've avoided because of anxiety.</p>                    <p>Examples of anxiety disorders include generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder (social phobia), specific phobias and separation anxiety disorder. You can have more than one anxiety disorder. Sometimes anxiety results from a medical condition that needs treatment.</p>
                    <p>CBT includes exposure therapy, in which you gradually encounter the object or situation that triggers your anxiety so you build confidence that you can manage the situation and anxiety symptoms.</p>
                
                    <div class="disTreatment">
                        <h3>Medications:</h3>
                        <p>Several types of medications are used to help relieve symptoms, depending on the type of anxiety disorder you have and whether you also have other mental or physical health issues. For example:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Certain antidepressants are also used to treat anxiety disorders</li>

                            <li>An anti-anxiety medication called buspirone may be prescribed</li>
                        
                            <li>In limited circumstances, your doctor may prescribe other types of medications, such as sedatives, also called benzodiazepines, or beta blockers. These medications are for short-term relief of anxiety symptoms and are not intended to be used long term</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Talk with your doctor about benefits, risks and possible side effects of medications</p>

                <div class="disease">
                    <h2 class="diseaseName">What is schizophrenia?:</h2>
                    <p>Schizophrenia is a psychiatric condition that has severe effects on your physical and mental well-being. It disrupts how your brain works, interfering with things like your thoughts, memory, senses and behaviors. As a result, you may struggle in many parts of your day-to-day life. Untreated schizophrenia often disrupts your relationships (professional, social, romantic and otherwise). It can also cause you to have trouble organizing your thoughts, and you might behave in ways that put you at risk for injuries or other illnesses.</p>
                


                    <div class="disTreatment">
                        <h3>How is schizophrenia treated?</h3>
                        <p>Treating schizophrenia usually involves a combination of medication, therapy and self-management techniques. These include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Antipsychotics</b>. These medications block how your brain uses certain chemicals for cell-to-cell communication.</li>
                            <li><b>Psychotherapy</b>. Talk therapy methods like ⦁	cognitive ⦁	behavioral⦁	 therapy (CBT) can help you cope with and manage your condition. Long-term therapy can also help with secondary problems alongside schizophrenia, such as anxiety, depression or substance use issues.</li>
                            <li><b>Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)</b>. If other treatments don’t work, your provider may recommend ECT. This treatment involves using an electrical current applied to your scalp, which then stimulates certain parts of your brain. The stimulation causes a brief seizure, which can help improve brain function if you have severe depression, agitation and other problems. If you have ECT, you receive anesthesia. You’ll be asleep for this procedure and won’t feel any pain.</li>
                            <li><b>Other medications</b>. Your healthcare provider might also prescribe other medications to symptoms that happen alongside or because of your schizophrenia symptoms. They might also prescribe medications to help reduce side effects of antipsychotic medications such as tremors.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Talk with your doctor about benefits, risks and possible side effects of medications</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                
                <div class="disease">
                    <h2 class="diseaseName">What is Phobia?:</h2>
                    <p>A phobia is an uncontrollable, irrational, and lasting fear of a certain object, situation, or activity. This fear can be so overwhelming that a person may go to great lengths to avoid the source of this fear. One response can be a panic attack. This is a sudden, intense fear that lasts for several minutes. It happens when there is no real danger.</p>
            

                    <div class="disTreatment">
                        <h3>Treatment</h3>
                        <p>The best treatment for specific phobias is a form of therapy called exposure therapy. Sometimes your health care professional also may recommend other therapies or medicine. Knowing the cause of a phobia is less important than focusing on how to treat the avoidance behavior that has developed over time.</p>
                        <p>The goal of treatment is to improve your quality of life so that you're no longer limited by your phobias. As you learn how to better manage your responses, thoughts and feelings, your anxiety and fear will get lower and no longer control your life. Typically, one specific phobia is treated at a time.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Talk therapy:</h3>
                        <p>Talking with a mental health professional can help you manage your specific phobia. The most effective treatments are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Exposure therapy</b>This therapy focuses on changing your response to the object or situation that you fear. Gradual, repeated exposure to the source of your specific phobia, and the related thoughts, feelings and sensations, may help you learn to manage your anxiety. For example, if you're afraid of elevators, your therapy may progress from simply thinking about getting into an elevator, to looking at pictures of elevators, to going near an elevator, to stepping into an elevator. Next, you may take a one-floor ride, then ride several floors, and then ride in a crowded elevator..</li>
                            <li><b>Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)</b> CBT involves gradual exposure combined with other ways to learn how to view and cope with the feared object or situation differently. You learn how to challenge your worries and put up with uncomfortable feelings. CBT helps you learn how to create a sense of mastery and confidence with your thoughts and feelings rather than feeling overcome by them.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Medicines:</h3>
                        <p>Generally, exposure therapy successfully treats specific phobias. But sometimes medicines can reduce the anxiety and panic symptoms you feel from thinking about or being exposed to the object or situation you fear.</p>
                        <p>Medicines may be used during treatment at first or for short-term use in specific, occasionally encountered situations, such as flying on an airplane, public speaking or going through an MRI procedure.</p>

                        <p>These medicines include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Beta blockers:</b> These drugs block the stimulating effects of adrenaline, such as increased heart rate, high blood pressure, pounding heart, and shaking voice and limbs that anxiety causes.</li>
                            <li><b>Sedatives:</b> Medicines called benzodiazepines help you relax by lowering your anxiety. Sedatives are used with caution because they can be addictive. They should not be used if you have a history of alcohol or drug dependence.</li>
                        </ul>
